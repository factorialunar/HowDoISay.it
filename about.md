Is the G in GIF pronounced like gift, or like ginger? Should you spell SQL or say "sequel"? Do you eat tomaytos or tomahtos?

This page wants to settle once and for all these debates and show you how certain words from the tech industry should be pronounced. Sometimes this is easy, when there is a consensus. Sometimes it is not. In these cases, in this page we will settle for the recommendation of the author. You may not like it, you may think the official name is stupid, and even you may be right. Still, this is a rational way to settle a debate as good as any other.
