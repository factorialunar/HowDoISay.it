The Graphics Interchange Format is an image file format for the web.

The debate of how to pronounce GIF may never finish. There's [a whole Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronunciation_of_GIF) devoted to it. Arguments on both sides are good: the G in GIF comes from "graphics". Some people spell it altogether. Steve Wilhite, the author of this file format, tried to settle the controversy: "It's pronounced 'jif' not 'gif'".
